**For the Meat:**

- 2 tablespoons picked fresh oregano leaves (or 1/2 teaspoon dried)

- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley or mint
  To Serve:

- 4 pieces soft, hand-pulled-style pita (not pocket pita)

## Directions

1. Combine lamb, salt, pepper, and oregano in a medium bowl. Mix with hands until homogeneous. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to overnight. Meanwhile, place yogurt in a fine-mesh strainer set over a small bowl. Allow to drain in refrigerator for 1 hour. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Place cold lamb mixture in bowl of food processor with onion, garlic, and bacon. Process until smooth a purée is formed, about 1 minute total, scraping down sides with rubber spatula as necessary.

1. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. With moist hands, form meat mixture into rectangles about 1 1/2-inches high, 8-inches long, and 5-inches wide. Bake until center of loaf reads 155°F (68°C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 30 minutes. Allow loaf to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes (or refrigerate for up to a week, see notes).

1. Adjust broiler rack to highest position (about 1 1/2 to 2 inches from broiler element) and preheat broiler. Slice loaf crosswise into 1/8 to 1/4-inch strips (each strip should be about 5-inches long and 1 1/2-inches wide). Lay strips on rimmed baking sheet lined with aluminum foil and broil until edges are brown and crispy, about 2 minutes. Tent with aluminum foil. Warm bread by placing on rimmed baking sheet and broiling until soft and pliant, about 45 seconds per side.
