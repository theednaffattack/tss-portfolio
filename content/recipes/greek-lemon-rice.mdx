## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 medium yellow onion (chopped, red onion will also work)
- 1 cup basmati rice (soaked and drained or thoroughly washed)
- 2 cloves garlic (minced)
- 2 tsp organic lemon zest
- 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth (or vegetable broth for a vegetarian/vegan version)
- 1/4 cup freshly-squeezed lemon juice
- 1 tbsp fresh dill (or to taste)
- 1 tbsp fresh parsley (or to taste)
- 1/4 tsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp dried oregano
- 1 pinch turmeric (optional but required if you want the bright yellow color in the picture)
- Salt and pepper (to taste)
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter (optional, for serving)
- Extra lemon juice (optional, for serving)

## Instructions

1. Saute the onions and garlic. To a large saucepan over medium heat, add the olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the onions and garlic and saute until soft and fragrant (4-5 minutes).
1. Add the rice. Add the washed rice and lemon zest, saute until slightly toasted (about 1 minute) stirring frequently to keep the rice from sticking to the pan.
1. Add the liquids and herbs. Pour in the broth, lemon juice, dill, parsley, cumin, oregano, black pepper, salt, and turmeric (optional). Mix and allow to come to a boil uncovered, then reduce heat to low and cover. Cook for 10-15 minutes or until the liquids have evaporated and the rice is tender but not sticky (time may vary depending on the rice you’re using). Stir, then taste and adjust seasonings, if desired.
1. Let sit. Remove the rice from heat and allow to sit covered for 10 minutes. Uncover and fluff up before serving. Optional: stir in the butter and/or top with a few extra drops of fresh lemon juice or crumbled feta cheese.
