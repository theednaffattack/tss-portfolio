Salad Mix:

Chilie Dressing🔥 Ingredients:

- 1 cup sweet chilli sauce → 240g / 240ml
- 2 tbsp ketchup → 30g
- 1/3 cup mixed achar pickle (pasted) → 60g
- (I used Ashoka Mixed Pickle, available in Morrisons / Asda. Any mixed pickle works) - Blend the achar (mixed pickle) until smooth so the sauce drizzles properly.
